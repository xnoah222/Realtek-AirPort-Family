# Realtek AirPort Family for macOS

Native-style Realtek Wi-Fi support for macOS.

**Realtek AirPort Family** provides native-style AirPort support for selected Realtek PCIe Wi-Fi adapters across multiple generations of macOS.

The project currently includes two drivers:

- **Realtek88LegacyAirport** — macOS Mojave through Big Sur (Realtek88LegacyAirport.kext + HS80211Family.kext)
- **AirPort_RTW88** — macOS Ventura through Tahoe (On Sonoma and Later you need to use Legacy Stack)

> **Realtek Wi-Fi. From Mojave to Tahoe.**

---

## Supported Hardware

Currently supported PCIe adapters:

- Realtek RTL8822BE
- Realtek RTL8822CE
- Realtek RTL8821CE

> [!NOTE]
> USB and SDIO Realtek Wi-Fi adapters are not supported.

# Installation

## macOS Mojave – Big Sur

Required:

- `HS80211Family.kext`
- `Realtek88LegacyAirport.kext`

Copy both kexts to:

```text
EFI/OC/Kexts/
```

and enable them under:

```text
Kernel -> Add
```

`HS80211Family.kext` must load before `Realtek88LegacyAirport.kext`.

---

## macOS Ventura

Required:

- `AirPort_RTW88.kext`

Copy the kext to:

```text
EFI/OC/Kexts/
```

and enable it under:

```text
Kernel -> Add
```

No legacy Skywalk stack is required on Ventura.

---

## macOS Sonoma – Tahoe

Required:

- `AirPort_RTW88.kext`
- `IO80211FamilyLegacy.kext`
- `IOSkywalkFamily.kext`
- `AMFIPass.kext`

The required dependencies are included in the release package for convenience.

Copy the kexts to:

```text
EFI/OC/Kexts/
```

and enable them under:

```text
Kernel -> Add
```

### Blocking native IOSkywalkFamily

On macOS Sonoma and newer, the native `IOSkywalkFamily` must be blocked so the legacy `IOSkywalkFamily.kext` can be loaded.

Configure the block under:

```text
Kernel -> Block
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Blocking the native IOSkywalkFamily is required on Sonoma and newer. An incorrect configuration may prevent the Wi-Fi stack from loading.

# Current Status

Both drivers provide stable core Wi-Fi functionality on their supported macOS versions.

Supported core functionality includes:

- Wi-Fi scanning
- Network association
- 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks
- Network switching
- Sustained network traffic

AirPort_RTW88 also supports sleep/wake recovery.

---

## AWDL / AirDrop

AWDL support in **AirPort_RTW88** is currently experimental.

Partial AWDL functionality exists, but AirDrop and other AWDL-dependent features should not currently be considered supported.

**Realtek88LegacyAirport does not support AWDL.**

AWDL is separate from the core Wi-Fi stability status of AirPort_RTW88.

# Previous AirPort_RTW88 Releases

AirPort_RTW88 previously existed as a standalone experimental project.

The releases published in the original repository were early development builds and contained stability and connectivity issues.

Those releases are now **deprecated and do not represent the current state of AirPort_RTW88**.

With the migration to Realtek AirPort Family, the AirPort_RTW88 version number has been reset.

The first AirPort_RTW88 release distributed as part of this project starts again at:

**1.0.0**

This release should not be confused with the historical AirPort_RTW88 1.0.0 release from the deprecated repository.

# Included Dependencies

Some external kexts are included in the release packages to make installation easier.

These components are **not developed or owned by Realtek AirPort Family** and remain the work of their respective developers and projects.

### Mojave – Big Sur

- `HS80211Family.kext`

### Sonoma – Tahoe

- `IO80211FamilyLegacy.kext`
- `IOSkywalkFamily.kext`
- `AMFIPass.kext`

Original licenses, notices and credits should be preserved.

# Credits

Realtek AirPort Family would not exist without the work and research of several open-source projects.

### Driver Development

- **Linux rtw88** — Realtek Wi-Fi driver used as the main reference and basis for Realtek hardware support.
- **OpenIntelWireless / AirportItlwm** — major reference for implementing native AirPort integration on macOS.
- **MacKernelSDK** — kernel development resources used for macOS driver development.

### External Kexts

- **HS80211Family.kext** — from the `sXmpwn/atheros-ke` project.
- **IO80211FamilyLegacy.kext / IOSkywalkFamily.kext** — legacy Wi-Fi stack distributed through `Edwardwich/BCM-WIFI-Sequoia`.
- **AMFIPass.kext** — distributed through `kaoskinkae/AMFIPass`.

All credit for these external components belongs to their respective developers and contributors.
